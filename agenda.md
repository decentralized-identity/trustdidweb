1. Welcome and Adminstrivia

    3. [did:tdw Specification license] -- W3C Mode
    4. Introductions and Agenda Topics
2. Feedback from implementing `did:tdw` Witness capability -- Brian Richter.
    1. Resolver has a /witness endpoint -- got the request from the DID Controller.
    2. Stuck on signing the entry. Both log entries have a did:key -- the witnesses must be published DIDs -- **SHOULD** be a did:tdw?
    3. Where to send the witness request? The DID Controller should know that. 
    4. Perhaps add an endpoint for the witnesses in the `witnesses` object? Decided no -- not to include the endpoint since that puts too much definition in the specification on how to implement the DID Controller and Witness interface. It is left to the DID Controller and witnesses to decide how they will interact. All that is specified is that  resolvers can verify the proofs via the DID referenced in the `witnesses` object, and the key identifier that references that DID in the proof itself.
    5. Use cases for witnesses -- (1) monitoring the DID controller to prevent maliciousness -- no backtracking, (2) preventing attacks on the DID Controller.
    6. Next steps -- Brian to continue implementing based on the discussion. Addition of weasel words to the spec to note the implementation challenges.
4. Spec. update to switch from a DID log entry being a JSON array to an object.  Feedback? -- Stephen Curran. Good to go with the names of the items in the object.
    1. General feedback -- all good.
    2. We reviewed the names and agreed with the ones in the PR now -- `versionId`, `versionTime` (both of which align with the DID Core spec query parameters), `parameters`, and `state`. `proof` is as defined in the DI specification.
6. Proof Chain vs. Proof Set
    1. Semantics:
        1. Proof Chain implies that that a subsequent signature is added to an existing signature, implying an attestation of that signature. But there are no implementations of it that we know of, and it's inclusion adds complexity without the semantics giving much benefit in `did:tdw`.
        2. Proof sets are just independent proofs across the same data.
    3. For now, let's just go with proof sets, as there is little benefit from using proof chains.
7. Update on the [did:tdw Web Server](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb-server-py) -- Patrick St. Louis.
    8. Demo given, but we ran out of time.
9. [DID Linked Resources](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/DID-Linked-Resources/) and did:tdw
    1. Should we?
10. [Spec. PRs and Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb)
11. Open Discussion

    1. [CCG Presentation on did:tdw](https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/archives/w3c-ccg-weekly-2024-07-09.mp4) (starts at the 5:40 mark of recording)
3. Brief(!) introduction to `did:tdw`
4. Discussion:
    1. What do you want this group to achieve?
    2. What would help you the most?
        1. Get to 1.0!
        2. Web server
        3. Next step topics -- witnesses, deactivation -- how does a diploma remain verifiable when the isssuer disappears -- with their web server.  Aka durability.
        4. Acceptance of the method broadly.
        5. How `did:tdw` compares with KERI.
        6. Test suite!!!!! Implementation consistency.
        7. Cryptographic audit on the techniques used -- hashing use, etc.
        8. Governemnt acceptance of the cryptographic suites being used.
        9. Switchcord is running live use cases based on `did:web` -- would like to transition to `did:tdw` and its features.
5. Feature list [feedback document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaKy0KbImVplW7xl2jMzI_MgayMQbI2o8TI6ZTvWHso/edit?usp=sharing) -- importance of features?
6. Future Topics
7. Next Meeting -- next week, same time
    1. Input to TPAC.
8. [Spec. PRs and Issues](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trustdidweb)
9. Action items and next steps:
    1. Stephen to create a PR to change the spec. to say that a version is an object, JSON Patch is no longer used, and that the Data Integrity Proof is across the version object, without a challenge.
    2. Everyone to look at the [list of did:tdw features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaKy0KbImVplW7xl2jMzI_MgayMQbI2o8TI6ZTvWHso/edit?usp=sharing) and comment on the features.
    3. Everyone to review issues and open others as needed, to drive future discussions.
